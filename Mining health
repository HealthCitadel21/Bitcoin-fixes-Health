Mining: Expending energy to solve problems in order to obtain a scarce and desirable asset

Concept of mining applied to health:

Energy: our time and attention
Scarce and desirable asset: Health

Expending daily energy towards the process of solving problems in order to improve our health

Proof of work: a daily health log

Block: the insights I gain and the lessons I learn each day as I tune into my health process (solving problems, experimenting, analyzing results)

Blockchain: daily blocks strung together to form a lifelong chain of experiences and lessons

Mission: empower individuals with the tools used to engage in the activity of mining health

As humans, health is our primary job. It's our most important work. Why? Because without health we canâ€™t live a good life

Protocol: A framework for understanding basic principles and templates for mindful experimentation using the scientific method

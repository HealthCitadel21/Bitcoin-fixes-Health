# Bitcoin-fixes-Health
A theoretical framework

Argument: Unsound money (fiat) is the root cause of the health problem. Sound money (Bitcoin) is the solution to the health problem. 

Notable point: The health problem is fundamentally an education problem.

Three most prominent and relevant problems caused by fiat:

- [problem 1] **Perverse** **societal incentives** which create a disease-centric society. Unless one is highly informed, the default state of modern humans is diseased. 
- [problem 2] **Corruption of the education system** (end to end, from kindergarden to medical school and everything in between) such that health is not taught. 
- [problem 3] **Time theft**. 

Bitcoin solves the above problems and therefore is the solution to the health problem.

Below: further detail for each problem & a perspective on how Bitcoin fixes each problem:



[problem 1] **Perverse Societal Incentives**

Notes: 
- Perverse incentive defined: an incentive that has an unintended and undesirable result that is contrary to the intentions of those who created it. 
- The cobra effect is a direct kind of perverse incentive whereby the incentive unintentionally rewards people for making the issues worse. 
- Example: Allocating money to subsizide cheap monocrops creates an incentive to grow the monocrops and this enables an abundance of cheap, nutrient barren foods to be created that wreak havok on our health. That mis-allocation is only able to happen because of an abundance of fiat available to subsidize disease causing crops.
- Fiat profit motives incentivize the commodification of human attention and strip mining it for profit while externalizing health and societal consequences.

- Bitcoin realigns societal incentives to benefit the greater good instead of offering fiat based incentives to those in positions of governance. These fiat incentives benefit few and harm many. 


[problem 2] **Corrpution of the education system**

Notes:
- Health is our natural default state as humans
- We no longer live in a natural environment
- The health wisdom of our ancestors is no longer passed down
- Learning health in school is one of the most important topics to learn about
- We do not learn health in school and this is a core element of the health problem
- Creating a framework for teaching and embodying health from kindergarden to the end of high school
- Corruption of medicine by Pharmaceuticals. This must be objectively reviewed and re-focused on health and healing instead of management of disease with drugs that suppress symptoms while making disease worse long term.
- Root cause approach to understanding health while offering tangible tools to enable change at an individual level. 

- Bitcoin ends the corruption of education by fiat. From first principles, we can develop an education framework that effectively teaches health and not simply disease management. 


[problem 3] **Time theft**

Notes:

- Health requires time. Time to understand how to take care of yourself and time to allocate towards changing lifestyle. 
- Every fiat dollar created without requiring work is stealing time from everyone who owns the fiat currency and had to expend time and energy to earn it. 
- Time theft through money creation forces individuals to work incrementally harder over time in order to receive less relative monetary compensation for their time
- When time is squeezed, health gets pushed to the side and we default to disease centric behaviours nudged by society.

- Bitcoin gives people back control of their time. They have more time to focus on their health. To learning about health, making changes in their lives and reflecting on the results coming from changes.
